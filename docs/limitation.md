# Limitations & Experimental Validation Needs

---

## 1. Thermal Cycling

- Unknown coarsening rate of Y₂O₃ + HfO₂ interface under >10⁴ plasma heat cycles.  
- Simulation suggests stability to 1500 °C, but only ion/plasma cycling can confirm.

---

## 2. Fabrication Scale-up

- Lab-scale HIP schedule validated for 5 g billet.  
- Scaling to >50 g may cause oxide clustering.  
- Requires pilot tests at 100 g scale.

---

## 3. Irradiation Validation

- Current tritium/helium results are from TMAP7 + OKMC simulation.  
- Needs He⁺/D⁺ ion irradiation experiments to verify trapping distribution.

---

## 4. Mechanical Properties

- DBTT simulated at 350 °C.  
- Tensile/impact testing required for confirmation.  
- Fracture toughness data absent.

---

## 5. Database Limits

- FISPACT cross-sections and CALPHAD parameters carry ~10% uncertainty.  
- Results are robust against ±10% composition variation, but absolute values may shift.

## Summary

DP-ODS passes **all six DEMO requirements in simulation**.  
Experimental work should focus on:
1. Fabricating 5 g billets.  
2. Irradiation testing with He⁺/D⁺ beams.  
3. Thermal cycling stability.  
4. Mechanical property verification.
